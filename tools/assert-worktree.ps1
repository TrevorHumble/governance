# assert-worktree: fail-closed check that the current session is running inside a
# linked git worktree, not the shared primary checkout. Two file-mutating sessions
# sharing one working directory can stash, revert, or switch-branch under each
# other's uncommitted work (an incident in the wedding-scavenger-hunt repo, issue
# #113, documented on 2026-07-02). That issue shipped the fix
# (tools/new-agent-worktree.ps1), but nothing in the pipeline asserted it was
# actually used; this script is that assertion. Pure check, no side effects:
# mirrors the shape of tools/check-freshness.ps1.
#
# `git rev-parse --absolute-git-dir` returns a forward-slash path that ends in
# `/.git` in the primary checkout and contains `/worktrees/<name>` in a linked
# worktree (verified 2026-07-02: primary -> C:/my-repo/.git; linked ->
# C:/my-repo/.git/worktrees/<name>).
